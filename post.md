Firebase is a cloud service designed to sync and store data to power real-time, collaborative applications. It removes the need for backend code to build mobile and web apps. Firebase apps can be written entirely with client-side code, update in real-time out-of-the-box, interoperate well with existing services, scale automatically, and provide strong data security.

Developers can add the Firebase library to their apps to get access to a shared data structure. This means any changes they make to that data are automatically synchronized with the Firebase cloud and with other clients within milliseconds.

## Firebase History

Firebase was built from Envolve, a website group chat service. Firebase takes that real-time technology and makes it broadly accessible to developers to build their own powerful applications such as real-time games, collaboration tools, analytics products, and more. It incorporates years of learning about how to handle real-time data on the web and solves many of the hard problems so that developers don’t have to solve them again. With AirPair, we make it even easier for you to get the support you need to delight your users.

## Sync Data, Don't Just Save It

Web or mobile Firebase-powered apps work offline, so when data changes, apps update instantly across every device. When your apps regain connectivity, data is synchronised instantly.

## Firebase Works on every platform

Firebase's full-featured libraries cover all major web and mobile platforms plus bindings for the most popular frameworks. Need something different? Never fear, Firebase's REST API has you covered. Firebase's REST API supports streaming so you can add realtime notifications to your app on currently unsupported platforms. 

## Get started FAST

With Firebase, you can save and update data, and listen for data changes in realtime with only a few lines of code. Data is accessible from any platform and stored as standard JSON.

## Keep your data safe

Our top priority is the safety and security of your data. Firebase requires 2048-bit SSL encryption for all data transfer and allows you to restrict reading and writing via granular access controls and custom authentication.
All data is replicated and backed up to multiple secure locations.

## Save data in the cloud

A Firebase itself is your realtime database, hosted in the cloud. Since Firebase is a NoSQL database you can easily store data as simple JSON documents.

Our servers are optimized for extremely low latencies. Firebase is fast enough for high performance real-time applications like multiplayer games. We maintain persistent connections between your clients and our servers so that data synchronizes both directions without delay. You can expect typical network latencies (less than 100ms) for data updates between clients.


## Realtime Data

At a high level, Firebase is simply a database with a RESTFul API. Each individual Firebase has a name and its own URL endpoint. Therefore if your Firebase’s name is my-firebase, the URL would be https://my-firebase.firebaseio.com/. Using this API endpoint you can easily store and read data right out of your Firebase.

Firebase isn't just an API though. After data is stored in your Firebase it gets streamed in realtime to every connected client. This means that Firebase automatically updates all clients with the newest set of data.

Firebase isn't just for realtime apps, it is for anybody that wants to write apps without having to run backend servers or write server code. Many developers prefer focusing on frontend rather than building, deploying, and maintaining server-side backend code. Even if real-time isn’t critical to your application, Firebase can help you build your application faster and scale seamlessly.

## Easy authentication

Firebase also provides a Simple Login Service with several types of built-in authentication. Simple Login allows you to authenticate with email and password or third party providers such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, and GitHub. If you need to integrate with your own login system, that’s no problem. Simple Login supports custom login methods as well.
